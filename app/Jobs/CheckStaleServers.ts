/**
 * Every minute. Two jobs:
 *
 *  1. A box whose agent has not pushed inside its window is marked 'quiet'
 *     (the agent went quiet — the box may be gone) and gets one box-level
 *     incident. A box that has never pushed is skipped: 'unknown' is not
 *     'quiet', so a server created in the dashboard does not page five
 *     minutes later while the operator is still running the installer.
 *
 *  2. Every box that IS inside its window has its status recomputed from the
 *     same windowed fleet the ingest uses and its incidents reconciled from
 *     that state. This is what makes the state machine hold on the tick as
 *     well as on the push: a 'hot' server with no open server_hot (a crash
 *     between the ingest's status write and its reconcile, or the
 *     post-backfill state) gets its incident within a minute; a breaching host
 *     that aged out of the window while another host kept pushing turns the
 *     box 'healthy' without waiting for the next push; and a 'quiet' server
 *     whose window an operator just widened leaves 'quiet' and closes its
 *     server_silent as soon as the samples say so.
 *
 * Every status write is a compare-and-set on last_sample_at: this job runs in
 * the queue worker and the ingest in the web process, and SQLite's
 * per-process transaction serialisation does not order them. If a push landed
 * between this tick's read and its write, the UPDATE matches zero rows and the
 * server is skipped for this tick — the push's own reconcile already ran on
 * fresher data.
 *
 * Nothing here writes a Monitor: the sites on the box keep their own verdicts
 * from their own checks, so the CheckStaleMetrics / EvaluateMonitorConsensus
 * tug-of-war has no two writers left to happen between.
