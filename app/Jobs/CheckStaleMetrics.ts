 * Runs every minute (see app/Scheduler.ts). The missed-push half of server
 * metrics (stacksjs/status#1): a reportsMetrics monitor is passive like a
 * heartbeat — if the agent stops pushing (host down, agent crashed, network
 * cut), there's nothing to poll, only a deadline to watch. When no metrics
 * sample has arrived within the monitor's `metricsWindowSeconds` window, the
 * host is marked down and an incident opened.
 *
 * The baseline is the last AGENT CheckResult (region 'agent'), NOT the
 * monitor's last_checked_at — reportsMetrics is orthogonal to `type`, so a
 * monitor that is also (say) an uptime check keeps last_checked_at fresh
 * from its own polling even after metrics pushes stop. A monitor already
 * `down` is skipped (a real push recovers it via ReceiveMetricsAction).
