/**
 * Project override of the framework's default RegisterAction (registered
 * in routes/api.ts, which wins over storage/framework/defaults/routes/
 * dashboard.ts's copy — user routes load first).
 *
 * Identical registration flow to the framework default, with one
 * addition: on success the issued bearer is also mirrored into an
 * HttpOnly cookie, exactly like LoginAction. Without this a just-
 * registered user has a token in localStorage but no cookie, so the
 * server-rendered dashboard (resources/views/dashboard/*.stx) can't
 * resolve them during SSR and the post-signup redirect lands on a
 * "you need to sign in" empty state. See Actions/Auth/authCookie.ts.
