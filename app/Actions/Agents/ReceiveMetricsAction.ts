/**
 * Public, unauthenticated: POST /api/agent/{token}/metrics. The token is
 * Server.metricsToken — unguessable, unique, and the whole credential (same
 * convention as HeartbeatMonitor.pingToken).
 *
 * Writes a ServerMetricSample, recomputes the box's fleet verdict (the latest
 * reading per fresh host; hot if any of them breaches), writes servers.status
 * and servers.last_sample_at in the same transaction as the insert, then
 * reconciles the box's own two incidents from that state.
 *
 * It never touches a Monitor: a sample says the box is busy or fine and
 * nothing about whether any site on it answers, so monitors.status,
 * monitors.last_checked_at and monitors.consecutive_failures all keep exactly
 * one writer — their own checks. (That is also why the monitor-49
 * probe-starvation guard that used to live here is gone: there is no probe
 * clock left to starve.)
