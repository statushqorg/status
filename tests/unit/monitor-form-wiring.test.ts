/**
 * Every field a monitor form posts must be read by the action it posts to.
 *
 * `health_secret` and `health_max_age_seconds` were rendered by both forms
 * and read by neither action for as long as the health monitor type has
 * existed. Nothing failed: the field accepted input, the form saved, the
 * redirect said success, and the value came back empty on reload — so it
 * read as operator error rather than a bug. It cost a live monitoring setup
 * an afternoon.
 *
 * No existing test could catch it. The unit tests call buildMonitorConfig
 * directly and passed throughout, because that function was correct; the
 * feature tests call the actions with hand-written field bags, so they only
 * ever exercised the fields someone remembered to type. The gap was between
 * the two — a field that exists in the markup and nowhere else.
 *
 * This closes it by comparing the two lists as text. That is deliberately
 * cheap: it needs no browser and no server, and the failure it prevents is
 * silent data loss, which is the kind worth a crude guard.
