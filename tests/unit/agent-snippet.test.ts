/**
 * The installer at public/install-agent.sh is the only collector this product
 * ships, so it IS the contract with /api/agent/{token}/metrics.
 *
 * It drifted from that contract once already: the endpoint accepted and
 * threshold-alerted `diskPercent` from the day metrics shipped, while the
 * collector sent CPU and RAM only — so a disk breach could only ever page
 * someone who had hand-written their own. These tests pin the collector to the
 * fields the action actually reads, and pin the dashboard to the installer so
 * the copy-paste command and the shipped script cannot drift apart.
