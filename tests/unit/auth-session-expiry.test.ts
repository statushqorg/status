/**
 * `tokenExpiry` is the browser session length, not just an API-bearer TTL.
 *
 * LoginAction mirrors the issued access token into the HttpOnly `auth-token`
 * cookie because the dashboard is server-rendered stx with no client
 * hydration; both that cookie's Max-Age and the `oauth_access_tokens`
 * `expires_at` row come from this one number, and nothing extends either.
 * At the old 1-hour default an operator was signed out mid-click an hour
 * after login no matter how actively they were using the dashboard.
 *
 * The value looks like a security knob, so it is an easy thing to "harden"
 * back down without realising a session rides on it. These assertions make
 * that a test failure rather than a support ticket.
