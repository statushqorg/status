# Monitors

A **monitor** is a single check that runs on a schedule and tells you whether one specific thing is healthy. StatusHQ groups related monitors under a **site** - a site is the thing you care about (an app, an API, a marketing page), and it can hold many monitors at once.

That means one site can have an [Uptime](/monitors/uptime) check on its homepage, a [Health Check](/monitors/health-checks) on its API, an [SSL](/monitors/ssl) check on its certificate, and a [DNS](/monitors/dns) check on its records - all reporting into the same place, the same incident timeline, and the same [status page](/operate/status-pages). Most monitors run from multiple regions with consensus, as often as every **30 seconds**, and every one can attach [notifications](/operate/notifications).

## Availability

Is it up and reachable right now?

- [Uptime](/monitors/uptime) - HTTP(S) checks with status-code, latency, and keyword assertions.
- [Ping](/monitors/ping) - ICMP reachability for hosts that don't speak HTTP.
- [TCP Port](/monitors/tcp-port) - confirm a port accepts connections (databases, SMTP, custom services).
- [Cron & Heartbeats](/monitors/cron-heartbeats) - watch scheduled jobs by expecting a ping on a cadence.
- [Health Checks](/monitors/health-checks) - fetch a JSON health endpoint and assert on individual fields.

## Certificates & DNS

Is the domain layer correct and not about to lapse?

- [SSL](/monitors/ssl) - certificate-expiry warnings at 30/14/7/1 days and fingerprint-change detection.
- [Domains](/monitors/domains) - WHOIS-based domain-registration expiry warnings.
- [DNS](/monitors/dns) - snapshot A/AAAA/MX/TXT/NS/CAA records and alert on any change.
- [DNS Blocklist](/monitors/dns-blocklist) - watch your true origin IP against public blocklists.

## Performance & security

Is it fast, well-built, and not leaking attack surface?

- [Performance](/monitors/performance) - track response-time trends and catch slow regressions.
- [Lighthouse](/monitors/lighthouse) - scheduled Lighthouse audits with score-regression alerts.
- [Broken Links](/monitors/broken-links) - crawl a site for broken links and mixed content.
- [Port Scan](/monitors/port-scan) - detect newly exposed ports on your servers.
- [Servers and metrics](/servers/) - push CPU, memory, and disk telemetry from a machine while keeping its monitors independent.
- [AI Checks](/monitors/ai-checks) - describe an assertion in plain language and let AI verify it.

## Next steps

1. Create a **site** for the thing you want to watch.
2. Add one or more monitors from the categories above.
3. Attach [notifications](/operate/notifications) and publish a [status page](/operate/status-pages).
