# Domain Monitoring

Your TLS certificate can be perfect and your servers healthy - and you'll still go dark if the *domain registration* lapses. Domain monitoring watches the registration itself via WHOIS and warns you long before the expiry date, so a missed renewal invoice never becomes an outage (or a lost domain).

## How it works

On each run the checker performs a **WHOIS** (and RDAP where available) lookup for your domain and records:

- **Registration expiry date** and days remaining.
- **Registrar** and **domain status** codes (e.g. `clientTransferProhibited`, `redemptionPeriod`).
- **Nameservers** currently on record.

Because registration data changes slowly, domain checks run on a daily cadence.

## What triggers an alert

- **Expiry warnings** fire at tiered thresholds - commonly **60, 30, 14, 7, and 1 days** before expiry - escalating as the date nears.
- The domain has **already expired** or entered a **redemption / pending-delete** status.
- The **registrar or status codes change** unexpectedly (for example, a `Hold` status that would suspend resolution).

Renewing with your registrar clears the warnings on the next daily lookup.

## Setting it up

1. **Add monitor** and choose **Domain**.
2. Enter the registrable domain (e.g. `example.com` - not a subdomain).
3. Confirm the **warning thresholds** or adjust them to match your renewal lead time.
4. Attach **notifications** - route these to whoever owns billing/renewals.

> WHOIS coverage varies by TLD. A few registries rate-limit or redact expiry data; where the date is unavailable we surface status changes instead and note the limitation on the monitor.
